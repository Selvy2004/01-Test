    <p>HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>, which can be a confusing term for many beginners.<br>
       The best way to explain HTML is to examine the meaning of each word.
    </p>

    <p><strong>HyperText</strong> refers to text that contains links to other texts.
        <br>Every time you click on a highlighted or underlined link that takes you to another page, you are using hypertext.
        <br>As more and more pages use hypertext to link to each other, a “web” of pages starts to form.<br>
        This is where we get the term World Wide Web.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Markup</strong> refers to the special symbols or codes that are inserted into a document to tell the web browser how to display the document data.<br>
      For example, markup code may tell the browser to display a phrase in <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italic</em> text, or may tell the browser which parts of the document are headings and which are paragraphs.<br>
      HTML is just one of a number of languages that uses markup code.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Language</strong> refers to the idea that the code is standardized. Just like regular spoken languages, there are certain rules that everyone must follow when writing HTML.<br>
      This is so that all browsers can understand and interpret the code.<br>
      There are many different programming languages, and you may have heard of some of the popular ones such as Java, Python and Ruby.
      <br>Each language has its own unique set of rules, and many languages can be used in combination with HTML to create amazing webpages and applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we put these three definitions together, we could say that HTML is “a programming language that uses unique code which allows you to display linked documents in a browser”.
